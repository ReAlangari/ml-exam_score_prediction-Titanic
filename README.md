# Machine Learning Project Collection

This repository contains 5 Jupyter notebooks demonstrating different machine learning models. The notebook `exam_score_prediction.ipynb` is the main one and shows the best-performing model.

## Notebooks Overview

1. **exam_score_prediction.ipynb**  
   - Predicts student exam scores using Linear Regression.  
   - Includes model evaluation and saving/loading with `joblib`.  

2. **linear_regression_models.ipynb**  
   - Compares Linear Regression, Ridge, and Lasso models.  
   - Uses cross-validation and evaluates test R² scores.  

3. **decision_tree_analysis.ipynb**  
   - Explores Decision Tree Regressor performance.  
   - Includes hyperparameter tuning and tree visualization.  

4. **random_forest_tuning.ipynb**  
   - Trains Random Forest models with hyperparameter tuning.  
   - Uses GridSearchCV with cross-validation for improvement.  

5. **model_comparison.ipynb**  
   - Summarizes and compares results from all models.
