🚢 Titanic & Exam Score Prediction
A machine learning project comparing Linear Regression and Random Forest across two datasets: student performance and Titanic survival.

📊 Results Summary
Linear Regression: ~73.7% Accuracy

Random Forest: Optimized using K-Fold Cross Validation

Key Features: Study Hours, Attendance, Gender (Sex), and Class (Pclass).

🛠️ Key Techniques Used
Data Cleaning: Handling missing values and category mapping.

Feature Selection: Removing "noise" variables with low correlation.

Validation: 5-Fold Cross-Validation for stable performance metrics.

Tuning: Hyperparameter optimization for Random Forest.
